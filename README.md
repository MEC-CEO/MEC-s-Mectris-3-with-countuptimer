# MEC-s-Mectris-3-with-countuptimer
This is my own Tetris clone in Javascript that I created for fun.
I was able to add a countup timer to tell you how long you survived. I will eventually add scoring, when I figure out how.
I hope you enjoy my project.
Remember, I only make games for fun, and the full versions of my games will come soon.

Sincerely, Mikey B
